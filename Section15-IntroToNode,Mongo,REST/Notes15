  - HTTP : Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
    - data sent through text, through the internet, from client to server
  - Clients send a " GET request" when typing "devslopes.com"
  - the server recieves the request, and accept or denies the request
  - when accpeted, it sends a response
    - response: Header, body(in JSON format or XML)
  - POST request (when posting something new)
    - "We" create a json body and send to the server, which sends to the db
