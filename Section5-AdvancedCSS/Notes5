Section 5: Advanced CSS: Building and styling website

26. CSS: Inro to building your first Website!
  Website includes:
    - navbar
    - button highlights
    - embedded video
    - responsive images, video, navbar..
    - 

27. CSS: Building the Navbar
  CSS Defaults: 
    - display: block; means elements will be displayed as a block
  CSS Navbar:
    - width: 100%; will have the navbar be as long as the page's width
    - margin: 0; make sure there is no default margin in the body/ no extra space on the sides
    - *want to be mobile responsive*
    - overflow: hidden; content is clipped and no scroll bar is provided
    - float: left; take all of these items and "float them left"
    - ul.topnav li a:hover {} means whenever we hover over the anchor, we do something (change background&text color)

28. CSS: Making the Navbar Mobile Responsive - Part 1
  - Make dropdown icon a class because we will specifically modify that element
  - Media Querie: will detect the width of display and add a breakpoint to it, to add new style properties
  - Not selector for the first child = :not(:nth-child(1))
  - As you build a website sections on desktop, start building it/designing it on mobile ***

29. CSS Making the Navbar Mobile Responsive - Part 2
  - diplay:block; when you put it in as a display of block, it makes it easier to position elements
  - often times, id's are often very abused.
    - it is bad practice to style elements using id's, you should use a class.
    - id's are more specific and allow us to interact with elements on a page using javascript
  - changing a class name by appending another string will change the class.
  
  - position: relative; will keep navbar unordered list stable and not be shifting around
  - display: inline; all list items will be grouped together, lining up like a span tag (in a row)
  -* Displays and Positions can be easily overwritten
  - to go from desktop to mobile CSS, make sure to look at the inherited styling and make sure to overwrite the styling you dont want
  javascript:void(0);
    - instead of putting url tag or destination, we are telling the browser
     "hey the path we are going to is undefined, so just stay on the page"
  - make the position of the dropdownIcon absolute befor you style the rest
  - position: absolute; keeps element stay where they are
    - add top:0; and right:0; to keep the element there...

30. CSS: Creating the Form Group
  - display: flex; be able to latch onto and grab any element inside the row,
    to help the elements change size
    - flex-wrap: wrap; all the elements inside the row, take the elements and wrap aronund underneath
    - align items: center; helps take the elements inside the flex container and center them.
    - create div tags to encapsulate sections, for future styling.
    - Header 1 tags have a margin, and labels/paragraph tags dont
    - its good to use line-height style when working with text, rather than padding, etc..
    - type - allows javascript to attain the info
    - placeholder - placeholder text inside an input field
    - name - another way to interact with the box..
