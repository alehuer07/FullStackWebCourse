13. How to use Inline, Internal and External CSS
  - Inline: 
      - inside the tags you put in a style tag
      - not very effective, not reusing code
  - Internal:
    - inside the header tag you put in a style tag and inside
      you identify the element you want to style folowed by brackets with styling inside
    - is better than inline, but can make the file get messy/large aswell
  - External
    - inside the head you put a link element like so: <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
      - the href is the path to the CSS file
    - you identify the element you want to style folowed by brackets with styling inside
