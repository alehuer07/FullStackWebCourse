13. How to use Inline, Internal and External CSS
  - Inline: 
      - inside the tags you put in a style tag
      - not very effective, not reusing code
  - Internal:
    - inside the header tag you put in a style tag and inside
      you identify the element you want to style folowed by brackets with styling inside
    - is better than inline, but can make the file get messy/large aswell
  - External
    - inside the head you put a link element like so: <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
      - the href is the path to the CSS file
    - you identify the element you want to style folowed by brackets with styling inside

14. CSS: Element, ID & Class Selectors
  3 Methods To Style Elements
    - directly target element
      body {}
      - every single element like an h1, will style every single h1 element
    - grab it by the class
      .square{}
        - these are great when you want to use the same styling across the web app

    - add an id to it
      * ID should be used sparingly, and the id should be very specific and unique 
      * shouldnt use ID all over the place, and should avoid using ID to style things
      - use the id sparingly, bc id's are mainly used for 
  
15. CSS: Colors
  - gradient is supported differently on certain browsers
  - the "parameters" following the shadow styling are "x and y coordinates"
