Section 10: Bootstrap 4: Creating a Login Portal

70. Bootstrap 4 Cards: Creating the Sign-in Portal Box
  - using regular container, so it doesnt take up the whole width of the page
  - put in empty col sections on both sides of the main col-8 section to give even spacing on the side
    - the empty col sections take up any extra space
  - create multiple classes inline to specifically target the sign-in containers/cards
  - can add custome CSS to alter the default Bootstrap CSS
  - use % for margins to have it be flexible

71. Bootstrap 4 Forms: Adding the input fields
  - make sure to specify the type of input
  - add classes, so that you can futher customize the CSS of each element/component
  - copied and pasted a form-group from bootstrap website and altered it a bit
  - 

72. Bootstrap 4 Buttons: Adding the Sign In button and Labels
  - The button should go inside the form, because it is part of the form
  - anything that is input related should go in the form
  - Bootstrap has different button sizes that can be used through classes(btn-lg)
  - can find a check box in form documentation from bootstrap

73. Bootstrap 4 Grids - Finishing Mobile Compatibility
  - dont have to change the empty col elements on either side, because they will just take up any extra space
  - when we hit a small state, we tell the viewport to have the column be a 12
  - inspect image to see what size to resize it to, use appropriate sized images instead of resizing in CSS
