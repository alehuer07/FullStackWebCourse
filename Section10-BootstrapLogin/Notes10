70. Bootstrap 4 Cards: Creating the Sign-in Portal Box
  - using regular container, so it doesnt take up the whole width of the page
  - put in empty col sections on both sides of the main col-8 section to give even spacing on the side
    - the empty col sections take up any extra space
  - create multiple classes inline to specifically target the sign-in containers/cards
  - can add custome CSS to alter the default Bootstrap CSS
  - use % for margins to have it be flexible
