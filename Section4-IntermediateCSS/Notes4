22. CSS: Google Fonts
  - developers.google.com/fonts for free fonts ->guids->fonts
  - pick fonts and then embedd them
  - have backup fonts in case your fonts aren't supported

23. CSS Images
  Border-radius: can enter in px amounts or percentages
    - if you have a perfect square and use 50%, you get a circle
    - px and percent is how much of the corner is taken off
  Padding: space between the border and the image

  img{}
    - max-width
      -take up 100% of the viewport
    -height to auto
    -padding to 5px to give space around image as it shrinks

    -opacity: goes from 0 to 1 (transparent -> opaque)

    -display: block (adds margin)
    -margin: auto
      - takes up any extra margin around an element and disperses it evenly
  
 24. CSS: Padding and Margin
  Margin: takes an element and creates space around the element, the element is going to push itself away from surround elem
    - number value
    - -bottom, -left, -right,... to specify where to put margin

  Padding: creates space from within the center of the element and pushes out to the edges
    - inner margin
    - can enter multiple values
      - values go clock wise (top, right, bottom, left)
      - if you only put 2 values of px, then the first value is for top&bottom while other is for left&right padding
      - if three values, then 1st-top 2nd-right&left 3rd-bottom
