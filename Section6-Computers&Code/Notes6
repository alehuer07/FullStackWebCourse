Section 6: Computers & Code

35. How Computers Work
  - How does input turn into binary?
  - physical keyboard action -> binary?

  BIOS - Basic Input Output System
  CPU - Central processing unit - brain

  Keystroke runs into BIOS
    - if "on the list" it will pass the information along
    - BIOS intercepts all input data
    - CPU fetches instruction from the memory to perform the right action
  
  Recap
  -Information is sent in to BIOS
  -BIOS allows/denies information to CPU
  -BIOS requests programs from memory
  -Programs turn on/off transistors
