Section 6: Computers & Code

35. How Computers Work
  - How does input turn into binary?
  - physical keyboard action -> binary?

  BIOS - Basic Input Output System
  CPU - Central processing unit - brain

  Keystroke runs into BIOS
    - if "on the list" it will pass the information along
    - BIOS intercepts all input data
    - CPU fetches instruction from the memory to perform the right action
  
  Recap
  -Information is sent in to BIOS
  -BIOS allows/denies information to CPU
  -BIOS requests programs from memory
  -Programs turn on/off transistors

36. Understanding binary
 ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange
  - a correlation chart from binary to a letter
  - a binary value == a letter
  
37. How code works
  - Source code -> compiler -> Low-level language
  Machine Code / Assembly:

  Assembly:
    - utilizes registers
    Registers
      - between 8-32 global variables which are the registers
      - can store information/calculations/instructions
      - what doesnt fit in the register is stored in memory(RAM)

  Shell program
    - program that runs programs
  Operating System
    - context switching
  
38. Heap vs Stack

  Heap:
    - *min*/max heaps
    - organized from least to greatest values
    - as you branch down the heap, the values get larger
    - consists of parents and children
    - use an array to "house" a heap
    - parent: index-2 / 2
    - childL: index*2 +1
    - childR: index*2 +2

  Stack:
    - LIFO: Last in First Out
    - push: puts an item to the stack
    - pop: remove the top item from the stack and return it
    - peek: looks at the top item
    - use an array

39. Understanding Hexadecimal
  - Decimal number is base 10 (0-9)
  - Binary is base 2 (0-1)
  - Hex is base 16 (0-9,A-F)

  Hexadecimal
  - A=10, B=11...
  - place values from right to left are:
    16^0 , 16^1, 16^2 ...

40. Variables and Storage Capacity

  Device Architecture
    - 8, 16, 32, 64 processor
  Variable:
    - a value that is stored in memory and use/modified by a program
    - int, boolean, ..

  Unsigned & Signed integers:
    - unsigned = positive or negative integer

  Decimal:
    - Double(64bit) or float(32bit)
    - double is more accurate
  String:
    - can hold 32bit or 64bit of data
