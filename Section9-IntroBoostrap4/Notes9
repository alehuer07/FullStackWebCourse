69. Bootstrap 4: Using the Grid System
  Containers: - MUST, HAVE TO USE THESE CONTAINERS
    - Standard Container
      - sort of a fixed size on the page, resizes with media queries
    - Container Fluid
      - fluidly keeps its relative width, which is 100%
      - spans the whole page by default
  Rows and Columns: - Grid System
    - Row: horizontal container taking up the whole viewport
      - by nature rows and containers inherit the height of the content in them
        - therefore we give them heights to see what they look like
    - Column: the only immediate child of a row
      - 

  - You can set multiple sizes of the columns inline for the different viewports
  - sizes like col-sm sets it for small viewports and above, unless overwritten by a larger one.
  - Columns all automatically stack when it gets to the mobile viewport
  - usually start with small (sm) column viewport
  - can nest rows and columns inside of columns
